## Safeguarded Data
Undergraduate students can also apply for a **Safeguarded** dataset held by the [Consumer Data Research Centre](https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/). There is a process to access these **Safeguarded** datasets, which is detailed on the [CDRC website](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/using-our-data-services). Please be aware that it normally takes 4-5 weeks for your application to be processed.

As part of the process, you will need to say in your application why you want that specific dataset and what you are planning to do with it. You will also need to have at least thought about the ethical implications of using that data and provide this with your data application (alongside your standard ethics application).

Some of the datasets held by the CDRC that you can apply for are: 

* [Bicycle Sharing System Docking Station Observations](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/bicycle-sharing-system-docking-station-observations)
* [CDRC Modelled Ethnicity Proportions - LSOA Geography]( https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/cdrc-modelled-ethnicity-proportions-lsoa-geography)
* [FCA Financial Lives Survey](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/fca-financial-lives-survey)
* [Local Data Company - SmartStreetSensor Footfall Data â€“ Research Aggregated data](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/local-data-company-smartstreetsensor-footfall-data-%E2%80%93-research-aggregated-data)
* [NHS Hospital Admission Rates by Ethnic Group and other Characteristics]( https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/nhs-hospital-admission-rates-ethnic-group-and-other-characteristics)
* [Speedchecker Broadband Internet Speed Tests](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/speedchecker-broadband-internet-speed-tests)

:::tip
**Tip**<br />
Given that the application can take several weeks, the Safeguarded CDRC datasets may be useful for your dissertation work but probably not for the GEOG0030 coursework assignment. However, any of the CDRC datasets that are marked as **Open Data** do not require this application process and you can download these datasets directly after registering on the website.
